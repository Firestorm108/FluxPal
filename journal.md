<h1>Summary</h1>
The FluxPal is made to be a soldering assistant to solve a lot of problems commonly encountered when soldering in a nice package! It has features I've always been wishing when soldering such as being able to check the temperature of anything, fume extraction, UV-A leds to reveal the flaws in the PCB and any flux left over, continuation testing, and nice lights (this is a big one I find it hard to see when soldering at night).

<h1>July 3rd</h1>

The first day! I worked up an intial diagram with all the currently planned features and overall design.

Gone are the days of hesitantly using my finger to make sure components aren't hot! 
I'm thinking of adding an integrated power supply for Pinecils for easy access.

Total Time Spent: 3 Hours

<h1>July 4th</h1>
After a lot of thinking, I decided to have a small PCB for the front part which encases:
-The screen
-The arduino
-The K-type thermocouple and amplifier
-The continuation buzzer circuit
