<h1>Summary</h1>
The FluxPal is made to be a soldering assistant to solve a lot of problems commonly encountered when soldering in a nice package! It has features I've always been wishing when soldering such as being able to check the temperature of anything, fume extraction, UV-A leds to reveal the flaws in the PCB and any flux left over, continuation testing, and nice lights (this is a big one I find it hard to see when soldering at night).

The first day! I worked up an intial diagram with all the currently planned features and overall design.

Gone are the days of hesitantly using my finger to make sure components aren't hot!
